Welcome to Bruteforce vs Divide and Conquer

After opening the folder containing the project, here is a list of things that you should do:

1)Open a terminal from folder so that your directory is the folder containing our code
2)Compile the Source Files:
	The only thing required to compile the source files is to type "make" in the terminal window
	This will compile all three source files for you
		1)create.cpp will compile and produce the exectuable "create"
		2)bruteforce.cpp will compile and produce the executable "bruteforce"
		3)divideconquer.cpp will compile and produce the exectuable "divideconquer"
3)Now you have an option, either:
	1)Use exisisting data points, in which case open one of 4 data sets that have been produced
		1)Data_Set_1
		2)Data_Set_2
		3)Data_Set_3
		4)Data_Set_4
		Each of these folders contains 21 files containing the amount of points listed in its title
		Remove all the files you want from the folder and put them in the main project folder, this makes them accessible to the program
		After they are in the main folder the two algorithms can be run on them
	2)Create new points
		To do this type "create" in the terminal to run the create methods
		This will ask you how many points you wish to create
		Input the amount you want and press enter
		This will output a file called "output____.txt" where ____ is the number of points you chose
		The file is ready
4)Run the algorithms on the point files
	1)To run bruteforce algorithm type "bruteforce" in the terminal
		You will then be asked which file you want to use
		Type the complete file name "output___.txt" where ___ is the number of points
		The calcualtion will then be completed and 3 things will be outputted
			1)The 2 closest points
			2)The distance between those points
			3)The time it took to calculate
	2)To run divide and conquer algorithm type "divideconquer" in the terminal
		You will then be asked which file you want to use
		Type the complete file name "output___.txt" where ___ is the number of points
		The calcualtion will then be completed and 3 things will be outputted
			1)The 2 closest points
			2)The distance between those points
			3)The time it took to calculate
5)Repeat steps 3 and 4 as many times as you want.
6)Type "make clean" to clean the folder and remove the executables from the folder

Files:
	1)bruteforce.cpp
	2)divideconquer.cpp
	3)create.cpp
	4)Makefile
	5)project.pdf
	6)Data.ods
	7)Excel_Data.xlsx

Folders:
	1)Data_Set_1
	2)Data_Set_2
	3)Data_Set_3
	4)Data_Set_4
	These are the data points we used to generate our data for the report.
	
Bugs:
	There are currently no bugs that we are aware of.
